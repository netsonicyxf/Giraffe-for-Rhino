Giraffe for Rhino
============================

-> create geometry containing all structural information, without leaving the comfort of Rhino.

-> export seamlessly into SOFiSTiK, using its very own syntax for property definitions.

-> need to adjust the model? do it directly in Rhino. the updated SOFiSTiK model is one click away!

Use:
1. download and save Giraffe.py
2. in Rhino, enter the command 'RunPythonScript'
3. point to Giraffe.py
4. your sofimsha input file will appear in the folder of your 3d model under the name 'system.dat'
5. subsequent runs will update this file automatically
