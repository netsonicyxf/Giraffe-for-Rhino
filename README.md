Giraffe for Rhino
============================

-> create geometry containing all structural information, without leaving the comfort of Rhinoceros.

-> export seamlessly into SOFiSTiK, using its very own syntax for property definitions.

-> update and organize all properties, sections, hinges graphically. As one is supposed to.
